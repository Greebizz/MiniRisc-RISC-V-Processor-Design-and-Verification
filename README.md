# MiniRisc – 32-bit RISC-V Processor in Verilog

## Overview

MiniRisc is a simplified 32-bit RISC-V processor designed and implemented in Verilog HDL. The project was developed to understand processor architecture, RTL design, verification, and synthesis using open-source EDA tools.

The processor follows a modular design approach, with separate RTL modules for instruction decoding, control generation, arithmetic operations, register storage, and memory access.

## Features

### Supported Instructions

#### R-Type

* ADD
* SUB
* AND
* OR
* XOR
* SLT

#### I-Type

* ADDI

#### Memory Instructions

* LW (Load Word)
* SW (Store Word)

## Processor Architecture

The processor consists of the following modules:

### Program Counter (PC)

Maintains the address of the current instruction.

### Instruction Decoder

Extracts:

* Opcode
* Destination Register (rd)
* Source Registers (rs1, rs2)
* Function fields (funct3, funct7)
* Immediate values

### Control Unit

Generates control signals such as:

* RegWrite
* ALUSrc
* ALUCtrl
* MemRead
* MemWrite
* MemToReg

### Register File

* 32 General Purpose Registers
* Two read ports
* One write port
* x0 hardwired to zero

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

Supports:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* AND
* OR
* XOR
* Set Less Than (SLT)

### Data Memory

Supports:

* Word Load (LW)
* Word Store (SW)

## Datapath

Instruction
→ Decoder
→ Control Unit
→ Register File
→ ALU
→ Data Memory
→ Write Back
→ Register File

## Example Program

```assembly
addi x1, x0, 100
addi x3, x0, 30
sw   x3, 0(x1)
lw   x4, 0(x1)
```

Expected Result:

```text
x1 = 100
x3 = 30
x4 = 30
```

## Verification

Simulation was performed using:

* Icarus Verilog
* GTKWave

Example simulation output:

```text
x1 = 100
x3 = 30
x4 = 30
```

## Synthesis Results

The MiniRisc processor RTL was synthesized using **Yosys Open Synthesis Suite**.

### Synthesis Flow

```bash
yosys cpu.ys
```

### Module Statistics

| Module                        | Cell Count |
| ----------------------------- | ---------: |
| Data Memory (dmem)            |       3380 |
| Register File (regfile)       |       3767 |
| ALU (alu)                     |        637 |
| Control Unit (control)        |         26 |
| Instruction Decoder (decoder) |         11 |

### Total Estimated Logic

```text
≈ 7821 cells
```

The majority of the synthesized area is occupied by:

* Register File (32 × 32-bit registers)
* Data Memory
* Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

This is expected because both the register file and memory are synthesized into flip-flops and combinational logic when no dedicated memory macros are used.

### Generated Outputs

The synthesis process generated the following gate-level netlists:

```text
alu_netlist.v
cpu_netlist.v
```

### Tools Used

* Verilog HDL
* Icarus Verilog
* GTKWave
* Yosys
* Visual Studio Code

```
